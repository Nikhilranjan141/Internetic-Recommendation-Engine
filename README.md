PM Internship AI Recommendation System

A lightweight AI-based internship recommender tool designed for the PM Internship Scheme.
The system helps students and youth—especially those from rural, tribal, and low-digital-literacy backgrounds—find the most relevant internships based on their skills, education, interests, and location preferences.
